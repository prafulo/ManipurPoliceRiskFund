## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2), evoking trust and reliability.
- Background color: A light, desaturated blue (#E0F7FA), providing a clean and modern feel.
- Accent color: A contrasting orange (#FF9800), drawing attention to key actions and important information.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a versatile humanist sans-serif for clarity and readability.
- Use clear, intuitive icons to represent membership status, payment options, and user roles.
- Organize the member profile screen to reflect the old-style forms that the user mentioned. A multi-column grid would work, but each field needs plenty of room.
- Subtle transitions and animations on data changes such as filtering of data or updating a data value.
